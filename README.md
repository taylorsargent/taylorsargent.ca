Ever since I was little I was always creating art, whether it was with paint, crayons, sticks or anything I could get my hands on. As I grew older my love for creating also grew.

I took my love for art and creating to a new level when I entered high school and was introduced to communication technology. Ever since my first class I knew I wanted to be a graphic designer.
